Etch A Sketch Project
* This is the second project from The Odin Project cirriculum. What this project focuses on is the use of recalling Javascript fundamentals while also implementing HTML/CSS 
foundations from the course. Googling things and using ChatGPT as a teacher to help is what will make this project go smoothly as I have already done a project
from their course.
